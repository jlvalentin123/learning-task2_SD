                    <p> McDonalds is the world's leading food service retailer with more than 30,000 restaurants in 118 countries serving 46 million customers each day. McDonalds is one of the world's most well-known and valuable brands and holds a leading share in the globally branded quick service restaurant segment of the informal eating-out market in virtually every country in which they do business. Serves the world some of its favorite foods - World Famous French Fries, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Chicken McNuggets and Egg McMuffin. As a result of many changes in the habits of Americans, competition and other factors such as the economy and profit loss, McDonalds attempts to continue new innovations and services. </p>
                    <p>   Because Americans are becoming increasingly health-conscious, many people have opted to avoid McDonalds’ due to the very high fat content and other unhealthy factors within the food. Therefore, in attempt to maintain customers and attract customers that generally avoid McDonalds, McDonalds has recently introduced the New Premium Salads . </p>
                    <p> The customers have the opportunity to add something to their Extra Value Meal (combo meals), create their own meals or choose a small snack. Customers also have the option to choose from the menu the McChicken Sandwich (crunchy fried chicken), McValue Fries, Soft Drink, Snack Size Fruit and Yogurt Parfait, Hot Fudge Sundae, 2 pies and a Side Salad. McDonalds can sell their products for cheap because they make most of their money through Real Estate, not necessarily through sales. Like an founder of the McDonalds corporation said, “We are in the real estate business. </p>
